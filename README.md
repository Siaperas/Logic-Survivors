#Logic Survivors

##Main info
LPS framework is a logic-based production system that combines production rules
and logic programs in an attempt to program intelligent pro-active and reactive systems.
Video games, in general, attempt to portray a rich environment, where their units
proactively try to fulfill a certain goal and react to the alterations of the world they
inhabit.
The aim of the project is to create a game, named Logic Survivors, using the LPS
framework. Its world would contain complex units, with rich behavior, that will seek
to proactively act towards a goal and react to the changes of the environment. For
the purposes of the project Weiâ€™s interpreter was used to test the capabilities and the
limitations of the framework.
